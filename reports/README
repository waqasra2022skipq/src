Billed Amount reports
---------------------
Use Original Billed date for complete results
  only way to see every transaction on a note.
Transaction reports only shows the transactions for a give time, not all the transactions for a note
  if a note was denied and paid later then won't show up unless the paiddate is used
BillAmt reports summarizes by BillDate using transactions and pushing them
  into the BillDate, changed OusStanding to AmtDue (5/2010) because
  notes which had been changed from one service to another insurance
  looked as if they were denied under the old insurance and outstanding
  (researched 5/2010 for chris)
  difference between Count on Original Billed report and BillAmt 
    is because of notes changed from one service to another 
    shows up on transaction reports but not note reports.
