Yet another acronym.  That was our attitude at first, but then we saw 
the amazing uses of this new technology called
<literal>GRXL</literal>.  Consider the following program:
    </para>
<?print newpage?>
    <programlisting>AH aof -- %%%%
{{{{{{ let x = 0 }}}}}}
  print!  <lineannotation><literal>wow</literal></lineannotation>
or not!</programlisting>
<!-- what font should we use? -->
    <para>

I'd have to say, "&thingy;".
