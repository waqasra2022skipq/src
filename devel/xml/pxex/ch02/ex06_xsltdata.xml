    <para>What a fantastic day it was. The crates were stacked
          high with imported goods: dates, bananas, dried meats,
          fine silks, and more things than I could imagine. As I
          walked around, savoring the fragrances of cinnamon and
          cardamom, I almost didn't notice a small booth with a
          little man selling brains.</para>
    <para>Brains! Yes, human brains, still quite moist and squishy,
          swimming in big glass jars full of some greenish
          fluid.</para>
    <para>"Would you like a brain, sir?" he asked. "Very reasonable
          prices. Here is Enrico Fermi's brain for only two
          dracmas. Or, perhaps, you would prefer Aristotle?  Or the
          great emperor Akhnaten?"</para>
    <para>I recoiled in horror...</para>
