    &companyname; has a new owner and CEO, Charlie Bucket. Since
    our name, &companyname;, has considerable brand recognition,
    the board has decided not to change it. However, at Charlie's
    request, we will be changing our healthcare provider to the
    more comprehensive &Uuml;mpacare, which has better facilities
    for 'Loompas (text of the plan to follow). Thank you for working
    at &companyname;!
