/**
 *  This function "patches" an input field (or other element) to use a calendar
 *  widget for date selection.
 *
 *  The "params" is a single object that can have the following properties:
 *
 *    prop. name   | description
 *  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   inputField    | the ID of an input field to store the date
 *   displayArea   | the ID of a DIV or other element to show the date
 *   button        | ID of a button or other element that will trigger the calendar
 *   eventName     | event that will trigger the calendar, without the "on" prefix (default: "click")
 *   ifFormat      | date format that will be stored in the input field
 *   daFormat      | the date format that will be used to display the date in displayArea
 *   singleClick   | (true/false) wether the calendar is in single click mode or not (default: true)
 *   firstDay      | numeric: 0 to 6.  "0" means display Sunday first, "1" means display Monday first, etc.
 *   align         | alignment (default: "Br"); if you don't know what's this see the calendar documentation
 *   range         | array with 2 elements.  Default: [1900, 2999] -- the range of years available
 *   weekNumbers   | (true/false) if it's true (default) the calendar will display week numbers
 *   flat          | null or element ID; if not null the calendar will be a flat calendar having the parent with the given ID
 *   flatCallback  | function that receives a JS Date object and returns an URL to point the browser to (for flat calendar)
 *   disableFunc   | function that receives a JS Date object and should return true if that date has to be disabled in the calendar
 *   onSelect      | function that gets called when a date is selected.  You don't _have_ to supply this (the default is generally okay)
 *   onClose       | function that gets called when the calendar is closed.  [default]
 *   onUpdate      | function that gets called after the date is updated in the input field.  Receives a reference to the calendar.
 *   date          | the date that the calendar will be initially displayed to
 *   showsTime     | default: false; if true the calendar will include a time selector
 *   timeFormat    | the time format; can be "12" or "24", default is "12"
 *   electric      | if true (default) then given fields/date areas are updated for each move; otherwise they're updated only on close
 *   step          | configures the step of the years in drop-down boxes; default: 2
 *   position      | configures the calendar absolute position; default: null
 *   cache         | if "true" (but default: "false") it will reuse the same calendar object, where possible
 *   showOthers    | if "true" (but default: "false") it will show days from other months too
 *
 *  None of them is required, they all have default values.  However, if you
 *  pass none of "inputField", "displayArea" or "button" you'll get a warning
 *  saying "nothing to setup".
