# below, !-~ is a range which matches all characters between ! and ~.
#  The range is set between ! and ~ because these are the first and last characters
#  in the ASCII table (Alt+033 for ! and Alt+126 for ~ in Windows).
#  As this range does not include whitespace, \s is separately included.
#  \t simply represents a tab character.
#  \s is similar to \t but the metacharacter \s is a shorthand for a whole
#  character class that matches any whitespace character.
#  This includes space, tab, newline and carriage return.
